# Youtube clone

Hey guys ‚úå

I'm really excited to see your beautful face right here.

This is a Youtube clone. I just wanted to train myself a little bit and help my mind recover all the knowledge I have for React.js

### Getting started

To get started with this beautiful UI build, you just have to have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

If it's okay with Node.js and npm, you can then fork this repository, clone it into your local machine and run `npm install` on your terminal. This will install all necessary dependencies in order to get started with this project.

After that you just have to go visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the UI build.

If you like it, come back to this repo and give this project a star ‚ú®

Else, just know that I love you and I appreciate your effort üòí
